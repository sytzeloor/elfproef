# Elfproef

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sytzeloor/elfproef.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sytzeloor/elfproef)

This gem adds three validators to your arsenal:

  * BsnValidator will validate Burgerservicenummers (Dutch social security numbers). It accepts both 8 and 9 digit BSN numbers.
  * BankAccountValidator will validate ING accounts (1-7 digits), and 9 or 10 digit bank account numbers using the elven-test.
  * PaymentReferenceValidator will validate betalingskenmerken (Dutch payment reference numbers) using a weighted modulus 11 and a length check.

## Installation

Install as a gem

	gem install elfproef

Or add it to your gemfile

	gem 'elfproef'

and run

	bundle install

## Usage

Using the BsnValidator

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates :bsn_number, bsn: true
    end

Using the BankAccountValidator

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates :account_number, bank_account: true
	end

Using the PaymentReferenceValidator

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates :reference, payment_reference: true
    end

You can also use these validators without `ActiveRecord` by including `ActiveModel::Validations`.
   
    class AwesomeDutchPerson
      include ActiveModel::Validations
      validates :bsn, bsn: true
    end
